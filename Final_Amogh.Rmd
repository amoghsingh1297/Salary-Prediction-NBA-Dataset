# Project Report {.tabset}

## Abstract
In Sports Analytics, there has been evergoing research on whether the market price of a Player is overpriced or not. Various attributes factor this analysis like Age, Position, games/minutes played,  player efficiency rating etc. This project aims to explore the dataset of NBA players based on salary and their season statistics for the year 2016-2017. The aim of this project is to generate a regression model that can be used to predict player's salary which can help in determining the accuracy of player's salary.

## Introduction {.tabset}

Prediction method based on regression model can be defined as: Regression models predict a value of Y variable from the dataset for any other known value or values X variables from the dataset. 
Prediction of regression model is based on:

* __y-intercept: Dependent variable__

* __x-intercept: Independent variable__

Prediction requires consideration of good attributes which depends on the type of variables considered for generating a model. This is important as the factors might affect the prediction of salary significantly. 

The coefficients in the equation have the relationship between each independent variable and dependent variable. While this is true, also entering values for independent variables into the equation for predicting mean value is achievable for dependent variable.

This is needed for generating unbiased predictions. 
Getting predictions precise is done when the observed values cluster are close to the predicted values. For solving this issue we can consider hypothesis 

NBA dataset is a good example for solving the task on prediction as it provides relevant quantitative variables like Age, PER, FPG, G, TS, AST and also some qualitative variables like Pos, Tm etc.

The dataset will be statistically checked to determine if assumptions are met to determine if Points Scored(PPG) is a factor that affects the prediction significantly i.e study will be needed to test whether the mean (PPG) differs and is a factor that is affecting the salary significantly. 

All statistical analyses will be performed using R (software version 4.1.2).

### Hypotheses
**Null Hypothesis (H0):**Mean PPG has no impact on salary 
$$ H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_1 = \mu_3 $$
**Alternative hypothesis (Ha):** Atleast some difference in Mean PPG impact salary
$$ H_A: Some~ \mu~ is \ne  $$

```{r echo=FALSE}
#datatypes for dataset 2
str(player_stats)
```

### Data Cleaning

__The filteration technique was used to obtain a dataset for player's stats based on the year: 2016__

__There was a need to mutate features like MPG, PPG, APG etc. to perform regression analysis based on per Game.__

__Filtered data can be viewed here as:__


```{r echo=FALSE}
#Filtering dataset for receving datapoints for the year: 2016.
#Selecting relevant variables like Year, G, PER, FG, PTS etc.
#Mutating columns named MPG, RPG, PPG, APG, TOPG, BPG, SPG for further analysis
filtered_2016 <- 
  player_stats %>% filter(Year == 2016) %>% 
  select(Year:G, MP, PER, FG:PTS) %>% 
  distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(MPG = MP/G, PPG = PTS/G, APG = AST/G, 
         RPG = TRB/G, TOPG = TOV/G, BPG = BLK/G, 
        SPG = STL/G)
filtered_2016
```

### Merging Data

__Our merged data betwen filtered_2016 dataset and season_salary dataset can be viewed here.__

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Performing full join using merge function for Joining filtered_2016 dataset and season_salary dataset based on common variable "Player".
salary_new <- merge(filtered_2016, season_salary, by.x = "Player", by.y = "Player")
# Renaming a column for salary
names(salary_new)[40] <- "filter_sal"
#Deleting unwanted column
salary_new <- salary_new[-39]

salary_new
```


### Correlation check {.tabset}

#### Correlation check No1

__Following plot is for checking correlation__

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Generating correlation plot for salary with other influential variables
#to check whether these variables have correlation.
corrplot(cor(salary_new %>% 
               select(filter_sal, MPG:SPG, 
                      Age, PER, contains("%")), 
             use = "complete.obs"), 
         method = "number",type = "upper")
```


#### Correlation check No2

__Following plot is for checking correlation__


```{r echo=FALSE}
## Plotting scatterplot matrix for correlation for features with salary variables.
# Made use of ggpairs function.
cor_salary_new <- 
  salary_new %>% 
  select(filter_sal, PPG, MPG, TOPG, RPG, PER, SPG, APG)
ggpairs(cor_salary_new)
```


#### Correlation Analysis

__Table shows the correlation value for the following variables__

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Correlation table
cor(cor_salary_new)[,"filter_sal"]
```

Correlation strength is:
PPG > MPG > TOPG > RPG > PER > SPG > APG

The interesting part of this is that the number of turnovers players make in direct correlation to their salary, and the relationship shows a positive correlation.

The interpretation can be demonstrated in the following way:

The more turnovers they make will result in increased involvement and outcome will be more ball movements in a game.

This way, we can claim that the players who make more turnovers, are directly or at important to their team. This can be expressed as "agressiveness". 

This assumption will be used in place of the duration for which player holds/contains ball in possession in a game.

### Data Visualization {.tabset}

#### DataSet plotting

Following plot shows the Boxplot distribution of Points scored per game. We can see multiple outliers in this graph. This graph display median value as 8. And, the outliers are accumulated near the range 25-30.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df,
       aes(x=PPG)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="blue",
               outlier.color = "#F56600", outlier.size = 3.0)
```

#### Interactive Plot

```{r echo= FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Generation of Interactive plot for plotting influence of salary received by the player over points scored per game.
#plotly function is used
#hoverinfo argument provides useful technique in generating a plot with dynamic nature. Extremely useful for plotting real-time data.
names(salary_new)[5] <- "Team"
plot_ly(data = salary_new, x = ~filter_sal, y = ~PPG, color = ~Team,
        hoverinfo = "text",
        text = ~paste("Player: ", Player,
                      "<br>Salary: ", format(filter_sal, big.mark = ","),"$",
                      "<br>PPG: ", round(PPG, digits = 3),
                      "<br>Team: ", Team)) %>% 
  layout(
    title = "Salary vs Point Per Game",
    xaxis = list(title = "Player's Salary in USD"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Point per Game for Player")
  )
```


When hovered over the highest valued data, we receive the following information for the data point.

* The most paid player with $34,682,550 is
  * Stephen Curry
  * Scores 30.063 PPG
  * Plays for Team: Golden State Warriors

#### Simple Linear Regression Model {.tabset}

##### Scatter plot with regression line

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Plotting scatterplot of regression Model for salary variable on Points Scored per Game to see variance in the graph
salary_new %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = filter_sal, y = PPG)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x= "Salary", y="PPG")
```

## Analysis {.tabset}

### Regression Analysis {.tabset}

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Fitting a multiple linear regression model by selecting all variables between MPG and SPG.
salary_regression <- 
  salary_new %>% select(filter_sal, MPG:SPG)
lm(filter_sal~., data=salary_regression)
```

* __Statistical Insights__
  * Salary rises by $998,724 per year due to the effect of Points Per Game by Player
  * More Assist Per Game also results in increase in Salary 

#### Trust Factor on Player(by Coach): Depends on Number of turnovers they make..

```{r echo=FALSE}
#For determining the effect of Trust on Turnovers.
#Obtaining average for MPG feature using mean function
avg.minutes <- mean(salary_regression$MPG)
#Obtaining average for TOPG feature using mean function
avg.turnover <- mean(salary_regression$TOPG)
#Converting categorical variable into factors for Yes and No values
salary_regression$Trusted <- as.factor(ifelse(salary_regression$MPG >= avg.minutes, "Yes", "No"))
#Converting categorical variable into factors for Yes and No values
salary_regression$Agressiveness <- as.factor(ifelse(salary_regression$TOPG >= avg.turnover, "Yes", "No"))
#Printing first 10 rows of the dataset
head(salary_regression)
```


#### Prallel Slope Model {.tabset}

##### Scatter plot coloured by how many turnovers they make

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Generating regression plot to determine any difference in salary based on Agressiveness
salary_regression %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = filter_sal, y = PPG, colour = Agressiveness)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

__This proves the Assumption that the player who makes more number of turnovers will get paid higher or will receive increase in Salary.__ 

### Modeling & Model_fit Results {.tabset}

__Finding Salary for an average player is necessary for determining the per salary increase after taking Trusted and Agressiveness factors into consideration.__

__An average player receives the following Salary per Season__

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Getting average player's salary by finding the mean for all players
mean_salary <- mean(salary_regression$filter_sal)
mean_salary
```

__Here we are generating a Multiple Regression model based on Factors like Trusted and Agressiveness__.

__We can determine the model_fit by obtaining the coefficients of the features__:

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Fitting a multiple regression model for salary based on Trusted and Agressiveness
trust_lm <- lm(formula = filter_sal ~ Trusted * Agressiveness, data=salary_regression)
#Plotting summary table for our regression model
summary(trust_lm)
```

__Obtaining Coefficients for the features__.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Coefficients Table
coef(trust_lm)
```

* __Results__

  * There is a direct correlation based on trust and salary increase.

  * This leads to more play time allowed by coach and increase in probability to score more Points per Game(PPG).

  * The salary will increase by __$311,416__.


### Analysis & conclusion

#### Prediction Function

Let's try to predict salary for the Most Valuable Player for the year 2016. The Professional Basketballer "Russel Westbrook" played for the team Oklahoma City Thunder and has a sensational season both in Regular and Playoffs Season as well.

<center>
![RB](Russel_pic.png){width=50%}
</center>

The statistics for his performance was referenced by the website [Basketball Reference: Russel Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/gamelog/2017).

Russel Westbrook's Statistics for the year was:

* __Points per Game (PPG): 31.6__

* __Minutes played per Game (MPG): 34.6__

* __Turnovers per Game (TOPG): 5.4__



#### Conclusion

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Building a prediction function for predicting value based on PPG, MPG, TOPG.
# Printing output value for our function
salary_prediction <- function(m, point, minutes, turn_over){
  pre_new <- predict(m, data.frame(PPG = point, MPG = minutes, TOPG = turn_over))
  msg <- paste("PPG:", point, ",MPG:", minutes, ",TOPG:", turn_over, " ==> Expected Salary for player: $", format(round(pre_new), big.mark = ","), sep = "")
  print(msg)
}
```

__Based on the stats for Russel Westbrook, we generate a prediction_fit model and compute the Prediction Salary__.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Fitting values for obtaining output
model <- lm(formula = filter_sal ~ PPG + MPG + TOPG, data = salary_regression)
salary_prediction(model, 31.6, 34.6, 5.4)
```

* __According to my prediction model, he will get $25,707,363 next season.__

* __The Official Salary Russel Westbrook received in his next season was: $28,530,608.__

* This resulted with a 93 percent accuracy for our prediction model.

* __We were able to determine correlation between variables and how they impact the player's salary__.
* __Through Hypothesis Testing, We were able to prove how highest correlated variable PPG has a significant impact on player's Salary and leads to increase in salary__.
* __Through model fitting, we successfully achieved the task of generating prediction based on highly influential variables__.  
* __We were able to achieve an outstanding accuracy rate of 93 percent using this model__.
* __We also were able to answer the assumptions of how a Coach's trust factor for a player increases Points scored per Game by a player and is able to generate more turnovers during the game__.
* __These assumptions also provided us with a new trend on determining significant impact (increase) in player's Salary__.
* Finally for checking the working of our prediction model, we Performed prediction for the Most Valuable Player for the year 2016: __Russel Wetbrook__.
